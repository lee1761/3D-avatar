This was for my Mater project (02/2021 ~ 11/2021).
This Avatar could communicate by voice and interact by virtual hand.

I made a Speech communication system with IBM Watson API (Speech-To-Text, Watson Assistant, Text-To-Speech).
I created an avatar with a website (https://avatarsdk.com/).
I put Facial animation on the Avatar by using Oculus Lipsync SDK.
I made some animations that could be executed according to different situations.

For the interaction by Hand, I used Leap Motion device and Leap Motion Plugin for the Unity.

The default animation is Breathing Animation.
If the users ask "Hi how are you", It will produce greeting animation and speak response.
If the users ask "Nice to meet you", It will stretch arms and hold on for few soconds.
Then, the Users could do handshake with the Avatar.
If the users touch the avatar's body, It will produce protecting animations and speak "Don't touch me".
